# neovim config

Another Lua neovim config, requires nvim 0.6.1+

These dots are pretty jank and will *probably* not work on your system, but good luck!

Note: There are large chunks of this config that are copied from, or modified versions of, the
[Neovim from scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) repo.
