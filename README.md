# Neovim Dots, ðŸ’¤ Lazy Edition

A port, with lots of unused features removed, of my 'pure' neovim config to one
built off of [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/).

Refer to the [LazyVim docs](https://www.lazyvim.org/) for setup
particularities. Otherwise, clone this config to `~/.config/nvim/`, start
`nvim`, and `:checkhealth`. The plugin manager `lazy.nvim` should be
automatically bootstrapped on first start.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal config that is often modified. There may be aspects that
will not work on other systems without some tweaking, and breaking changes may
be made without notice at any time. Please be careful if you wish to use this
config yourself, as some modification will likely be required.
